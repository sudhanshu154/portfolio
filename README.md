## Getting Started

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
   Or download the ZIP and extract it.

2. **Open the Project**
   Open `index.html` in your web browser. No build step is required.

3. **Customize**
   - Update images in the `images/` folder as needed.
   - Edit `index.html` to change content, skills, or experience.
   - Update contact form settings in the HTML if you want to use your own Web3Forms key.

## Experience Section
- Now includes **AJIO** as the latest company, alongside Physics Wallah and HealthEdge.
- Experience entries are displayed in columns for a clean, modern look.

## Slider Optimization
- The technology slider uses **Owl Carousel** with `loop: true` and `autoplay` for a smooth, seamless experience.
- All manual CSS animation and duplicate slides have been removed for better performance and maintainability.
- To adjust speed, modify `autoplayTimeout` and `smartSpeed` in the JS initialization.
